Hi!

My name is Andrew. I live in Figueira da Foz, Portugal.

I have been working for more than 10 years as a graphic and technical designer and later as UI/UX designer.

I worked with guidelines and design systems, conducted usability sessions and research analysis, created wire frames, and rapid and high-resolution prototypes. I managed the research, interviewed stakeholders, and worked on user scenarios.

I worked in a team and also as the only designer being in close collaboration with business owners, stakeholders and business analysts. My job was to redesign existing solutions and also to create new ones from scratch.
